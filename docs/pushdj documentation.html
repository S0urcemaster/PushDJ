<H1 CLASS="western">PushDJ Documentation</H1>
<P CLASS="western">PushDJ is a software MIDI transceiver to connect
Ableton Push to Native Instruments' Traktor. It aims on improving the
workflow of mixing music compared to a common DJ controller.
Originated more from necessity, it can or already has functions and
capabilities not found on a common DJ controller and tries to push
Traktor to its limit.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Setup</H2>
<OL>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Start Traktor and import PushDJ.tsi. Close
	Traktor again.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Start PushDJ.jar. Push's display and buttons
	change.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Start Traktor. Push's display changes again.</P>
	<LI><P CLASS="western">Load a track into A and push the red button
	on the bottom left to play the track.</P>
</OL>
<H3 CLASS="western">Troubleshooting</H3>
<P CLASS="western">Connect Ableton Push to your PC and start
PushDJ.jar, if your windows recognizes executable jar files or
start.bat if not. PushdJ.jar has the cleaner start as it doesn't open
a console/cmd window. The additional console windows will display
errors. Use it if you encounter problems.</P>
<P CLASS="western">The graphical user interface is unused at the
moment. Any function of the buttons is not intended and should not be
used.</P>
<P CLASS="western">After the PushDJ window pops up, the Push device's
buttons should change color and the display its text. <B>The push
buttons and knobs are not working as long as Traktor is not running.</B>
When starting Traktor, Push's display will change again according to
the MIDI outs set in Traktor's controller manager.</P>
<P CLASS="western">Locate PushDJ.tsi in PushDJ's directory and import
it in Traktor's controller manager:</P>
<PRE CLASS="western">Add &rarr; Import TSI &rarr; Import other</PRE><P CLASS="western">
At the moment, Traktor has problems detecting the virtual MIDI device
set up by PushDJ when Traktor is running. Restart Traktor to make it
detect the PushDJ device. In controller manager there should be a
device called</P>
<PRE CLASS="western">Generic MIDI (PushDJ)</PRE><P CLASS="western">
If you select it, the IN and OUT port should display</P>
<PRE CLASS="western">PushDJ</PRE><P CLASS="western">
There were situations where Push was unresponsible even the setup was
correct, then it helped to turn Push off and on again.</P>
<P CLASS="western">If you still have problems, contact me on any of
my PushDJ videos on Youtube: <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVTUYV3g5TsByOTehro4oNg">Sebastian

<H2 CLASS="western">Controlling Traktor</H2>
<P CLASS="western"><I>PushDJ is in alpha state and functions will be
added in the future.</I></P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Overview</H3>
<P CLASS="western"><A HREF="images/push traktor map.jpg"><IMG SRC="images/push%20traktor%20map.jpg" NAME="Grafik1" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=1123 HEIGHT=794 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT></A>PushDJ
is planned to controlling all 4 Traktor decks as Track, Remix and
Stem decks. In it's current early state only the first 3 decks and
only the track deck type is implemented. As to Push's nature, any
function of Traktor that is best used with faders like volume is
supposed to be used with a different controller. Myself, i'm using a
Vestax VCM-600 controller which is usually used for production like
Ableton.</P>
<P CLASS="western"><B>Volume, EQs and filter knobs and faders are not
implemented in PushDJ and are not planned to be. For mixing music it
is stringently required to use another controller together with
PushDJ.</B></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-weight: normal">For the effects
section of Traktor, i consider the advantages of implementing it on
Push but as it is now, the effects are easily mapped on my vestax
controller and I regard it &bdquo;ok&ldquo; for use in my mixes.</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Functions that will most likely not change</H3>
<P CLASS="western">The biggest advantage of PushDJ compared to a
common DJ controller is the opened up MOVE and CUE section of
Traktor. While there are often only 4 cue buttons per deck and the
other 4 are only accessible through a shift button as well as the
MOVE section is completely unpresent or only accessible through shift
buttons as well, Ableton Push has a lot of button to map these
functions to.</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">2- Decks view</H4>
<P CLASS="western">The Push's button matrix is split in two in a left
and right side which will display the functions for a Traktor deck.
The only possible layout for a deck at the moment is a track deck.
Each of the sections of a track deck on Push will be now explained:</P>
<H5 CLASS="western">Start/Stop, Cue, Sync, Master</H5>
<P CLASS="western">Simply accords to the Traktor functions and common
DJ controllers. The Sync button just taps the phase to zero. To
permanently turn on/off Sync use <B>PushDJ's Shift button</B> which
is the Play button on push.</P>
<H5 CLASS="western">8 Cue points</H5>
<P CLASS="western">This is the common use of cue points. Pressing a
button will jump to the existant cue point or create a new one. To
delete a cue point, use <B>PushDJ's Delete-Shift button</B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">,
which is the Record button on Push.</SPAN></P>
<H5 CLASS="western">4 Jog Turn buttons</H5>
<P CLASS="western">You are not required to use a common DJ controller
together with PushDJ. It is intended to have only another controller
for the volume fade and EQ section. So the Jog Turn function will be
missing if you don't want to mix in sync mode and for positioning
off-beat. So, the 2 middle buttons are for fine jog and the outer
buttons for coarse jog movement.</P>
<H5 CLASS="western">BeatJump and Cue Loops</H5>
<P CLASS="western">You can set the BeatJump size, of the loop and its
IN and OUT points directly wtih Push's &bdquo;resolution&ldquo;
buttons right beside the button matrix. The size applies to any
movement and any deck. The ability in Traktor to set the move size
for any deck and loop and BeatJump separately is being considered
oversized and complicated.</P>
<P CLASS="western">There are 2 move buttons for left and right
direction each for BeatJump, Loop in its whole, Loop In and Loop Out.
<B>The Loop In and Loop Out buttons are not present</B> instead there
are 2 buttons for setting and activation a loop:</P>
<PRE CLASS="western">Loop Size Select + Set
Backward Loop Size Select + Set</PRE><P CLASS="western">
Loop Size Select + Set is the</P>
<P CLASS="western">If you push these buttons a loop of the adjusted
size is created and activated. The intention of the rework is, to
make it easier to mix songs that are not well known. &bdquo;(Backward)
Loop Size Select + Set&ldquo; is a feature only present as MIDI
mapping in Traktor's controller manager and not on the Traktor
frontend, but i find working with loops much easier with them than
with the common</P>
